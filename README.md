# MyReads Project - Stephen Orsino

This is the first project for Udacity's React Nonodegree curriculum.  This app uses React to display three catagories of books; Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. These catagories are diplayed in three sections and in these sections, the books which were placed in that catagory are displayed by thumnail for the book's cover (if available), the book's title, and author(s). A control is provided to allow the user to select a different catagory for each book, and the app will then immediately display the book in the correct catagory.

A search page is linked to from the main page, where books may be searched for via a textual input field. While typing, the books matching the criteria will display under the search field. These books also display with a control to allow a user to select a shelf to place this book. If the book already appears on a shelf, that shelf is automatically selected and may be changed.  If not currently on a shelf, the none catagory will be automatically selected in the book's control. A link back to the main page is located to the left of the search field. If the self of a book was selected or changed, that book will now appear on it's proper shelf.
